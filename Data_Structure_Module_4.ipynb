        "Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to make it easier to access, modify, and manage. They are important because they optimize the efficiency of algorithms, improving the speed and scalability of programs. Properly chosen data structures can significantly reduce time and space complexity.\n",

        "For example:\n",
        "- **Array**: Stores elements in a fixed-size sequential structure, allowing quick access via indices.\n",
        "- **Linked List**: Stores elements in nodes, each pointing to the next, allowing efficient insertions and deletions.\n",
        "- **Stack**: Follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) order, useful for tasks like undo operations.\n",
        "- **Tree**: Organizes data hierarchically, enabling fast searching, insertion, and deletion (e.g., binary search trees).\n",
